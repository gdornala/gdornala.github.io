**Basic Constructor**
```
var User = function(name, age) {
	this.name = name,
    this.age = age;
    var getName = function() {
    	return this.name;
    }
}
var newUser = new User();
```
This pattern contains two problems:
1. It is hard to have inheritance
2. The code of methods is shared across all the user Objects.
